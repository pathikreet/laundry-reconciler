## 2026-02-23 - Progressive Disclosure for Long Processes
**Learning:** In Streamlit apps, sequential `st.info` messages for multi-step processes create clutter and don't effectively communicate progress. `st.status` containers provide a clean, collapsible way to show detailed progress without overwhelming the user, while still giving the crucial "something is happening" feedback.
**Action:** Use `st.status` for any process involving more than 2 distinct steps or taking > 3 seconds.

## 2026-02-24 - Provide Data Previews
**Learning:** In data upload forms, users often doubt if they uploaded the correct file (especially with ambiguous names like "export.csv"). Providing a small, embedded preview of the data (e.g. first 5 rows) immediately after upload builds confidence before they commit to an import action.
**Action:** Use `st.expander` with `pd.read_csv` or `pd.read_excel` to show a snapshot of uploaded data, remembering to reset the file pointer (`.seek(0)`) to not break downstream logic.
